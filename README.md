# ANTI-Soch

**An Anti-Harassment Community**  
A community-powered safety education, support, and emergency response ecosystem focused on personal safetyâ€”especially for women and children. Combines a mobile/web app with a hardware safety device, AI-guided emotional support, and real-time emergency alerting.


## Problem
Personal safety still feels like a privilege. Victims of harassment often suffer in silence, lack early education about unsafe behavior, and have few platforms that proactively educate, emotionally support, and rapidly respond during danger. Existing solutions are mostly reactive and fail to create a safe, stigma-free space.

## Solution Overview
ANTI-Soch is a blended ecosystem composed of:
- A safety and healing mobile/web application (with differentiated experiences for minors and adults)
- An AI chatbot counsellor for emotional support and escalation to professionals
- A patented hardware safety device that triggers instant alerts, records incidents, and sends crucial data without needing to unlock a phone

## Key Features

### For Under-18 Users
- Safe, kid-friendly interface
- Interactive education (e.g., good touch/bad touch, legal rights)
- Gamified learning to reinforce safety concepts

### For 18+ Users
- Anonymous experience-sharing forums
- Community support and connection
